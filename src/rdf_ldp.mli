(** A Linked Data Platform Resource (LDPR) whose state is NOT represented as RDF. *)

(** Indicates the membership-constant-URI in a membership triple.  Depending upon the membership triple pattern a container uses, as indicated by the presence of ldp:hasMemberRelation or ldp:isMemberOfRelation, the membership-constant-URI might occupy either the subject or object position in membership triples. *)
val membershipResource : Iri.t

(** Link to a page sequence resource, as defined by LDP Paging.  Typically used to communicate the sorting criteria used to allocate LDPC members to pages. *)
val pageSequence : Iri.t

(** The collation used to order the members across pages in a page sequence when comparing strings. *)
val pageSortCollation : Iri.t

(** Link to the list of sorting criteria used by the server in a representation.  Typically used on Link response headers as an extension link relation URI in the rel= parameter. *)

(** The ascending/descending/etc order used to order the members across pages in a page sequence. *)
val pageSortOrder : Iri.t

(** Predicate used to specify the order of the members across a page sequence's in-sequence page resources; it asserts nothing about the order of members in the representation of a single page. *)
